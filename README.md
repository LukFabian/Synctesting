# Overview of the `synctest` Package

The `synctest` package in Go provides a framework for testing concurrent behavior in a deterministic, race-free manner. It is particularly valuable for validating interactions between goroutines and ensuring consistent scheduling, addressing common challenges in concurrent programming.

## Prerequisites

To use the `synctest` package, ensure you are running **Go 1.22** or later, which includes the `synctest` package and its synthetic scheduling capabilities.

Verify your Go version with:

```bash
go version
```

## Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to test `context.AfterFunc` deterministically using `synctest`. Run the test from your project directory with:

```bash
export GOEXPERIMENT=synctest
export GODEBUG=asynctimerchan=0
go test -run TestAfterFunc
```

To enable race condition checking, use:

```bash
go test -race -run TestHandleEchoAck
```

### Environment Variables Explained
- **`GOEXPERIMENT=synctest`**: Activates the synthetic scheduler for deterministic testing.
- **`GODEBUG=asynctimerchan=0`**: Disables asynchronous timers to ensure consistent execution.

## What Issue Does It Solve? Typical Use Cases

The `synctest` package addresses the nondeterminism and fragility of tests involving concurrency and time in Go. Traditional approaches using `time.Sleep` or real timers often lead to flaky tests and delays, particularly in environments with variable load or latency, such as continuous integration (CI) pipelines.
To understand the benefits, two important concepts have to be explained

### Virtual Time ("Testing Time")

One of the most powerful features of the synctest package is virtual time, also referred to as testing time. In traditional tests, functions like time.Sleep or time.After rely on wall-clock time, which slows down tests and can introduce flakiness. In contrast, synctest replaces real time with a virtual clock that only advances when the program is idle—when all goroutines are blocked and there's no work to do.

This means:

- There's no need to sleep for real durations during testing.
- Tests that rely on timeouts or delays can run instantly and deterministically.
- You no longer have to guess durations that will "probably be long enough" under load.

In the [main_test.go](main_test.go) file, the TestAfterFunc test showcases this behavior clearly:
```go
context.AfterFunc(ctx, func() {
	funcCalled = true
})
```
Without synctest, testing whether AfterFunc executes correctly would normally require waiting in real time. Instead, `synctest.Wait()` allows the test to pause and resume precisely when the virtual clock deems it appropriate—without sleeping. This makes tests both faster and more reliable.
Similarly, in [TestPollChannel](main_test.go), the test sets up a condition to trigger a callback only after a signal is received on a channel:
```go
pollChannel(signalChan, func() {
	called = true
})
```
Using `synctest.Wait()` before and after signaling the channel lets you validate time-sensitive behavior instantly—without introducing arbitrary sleep statements or risking race conditions.

### Detecting Goroutine Leaks and Stalled Routines ("Blocking and the Bubble")

Another critical feature of synctest is its ability to detect goroutine leaks and stalled (blocked) routines using what the Go team refers to as "the bubble".

#### What is the Bubble?

In synctest, all goroutines start inside a "bubble" managed by the synthetic scheduler. As long as goroutines are inside the bubble, the test has control over them—it can pause, resume, and coordinate their execution deterministically.

If a goroutine:
- Makes a system call,
- Performs a CGO operation,
- Or blocks in a way the scheduler can't track,

it escapes the bubble. This is problematic because such goroutines can:

- Become invisible to the scheduler,
- Cause tests to hang or pass incorrectly, 
- Leak resources silently.

Take [TestHandleEchoAck](main_test.go) as an example. The test uses net.Pipe() to create in-memory network connections, and launches a goroutine to process input via:
```go
go handleEchoAck(srv)
```

By wrapping the test in `synctest.Run()` and calling `synctest.Wait()`, the scheduler ensures that this goroutine and the client both complete their expected work. If either goroutine were to stall or hang, the test would fail with a clear indication of which routine didn’t exit the bubble properly.

#### Leak Detection

synctest flags any goroutines that:

- Remain active after the test completes,
- Block indefinitely on channels or mutexes,
- Escape the scheduler's control.

This helps ensure that tests do not silently leak goroutines, which could otherwise go unnoticed until they accumulate in production.

### Typical Use Cases
- Testing time-based behavior (e.g., `time.After`, `context.WithTimeout`, `context.AfterFunc`)
- Verifying synchronization between goroutines
- Ensuring deterministic scheduling in concurrent algorithms
- Detecting goroutine leaks and stalled routines

By virtualizing time and scheduling, `synctest` enables deterministic and efficient testing of concurrent code.

## Is the Solution Fully Satisfactory?

The `synctest` package is effective within its intended scope but comes with certain constraints.

### Strengths
- **Virtual Time**: Automatically advances, eliminating the need for real-time delays.
- **Deterministic Execution**: Ensures reliable testing of concurrent behavior.
- **Race Detection**: Integrates with Go’s race detector to identify data races.
- **Goroutine Leak Detection**: Automatically detects leaked or blocked goroutines, improving test coverage.

### Limitations
- **Unsupported Primitives**: Blocking operations outside Go’s scheduler (e.g., network I/O, syscalls, CGO) are not visible to the `synctest` scheduler.
- **Experimental Status**: Requires enabling via `GOEXPERIMENT=synctest`.
- **Compatibility**: Code under test must use supported blocking patterns to be compatible.

While not universally applicable, `synctest` significantly enhances testing for many concurrency-related scenarios.

## Why Is It Important?

Reliable and deterministic testing of concurrent programs is a longstanding challenge in systems software. The `synctest` package represents a significant advancement by enabling fast, reliable, and race-aware tests for time-sensitive and multi-goroutine code.

### Key Impacts
- **Test Stability**: Improves the reproducibility of test suites.
- **Bug Detection**: Facilitates early identification of subtle timing or synchronization issues.
- **Complex Concurrency**: Encourages the adoption of advanced concurrency patterns by making them testable.

Although currently experimental, `synctest` is a notable development in Go’s testing ecosystem and is proposed to become non-experimental in **Go 1.25**.
